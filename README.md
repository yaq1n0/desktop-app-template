# Python 3 Tk based Desktop GUI App template

### Origins

This was forked from a Python software engineering group coursework I made in my Engineering Foundation Year.
99% of the code is mine as I was the only one who could actually code amongst the engineers.
The source code for the [rotational-dynamics-python](https://github.com/yaq1n0/rotational-dynamics-python) coursework
can be found here.

### Seeing Potential

I saw the potential in repurposing the GUI elements and codebase for the coursework into a template/framework that I
could use in the future.
I eventually want to make it such that I can quickly implement backend functionality seperately to the front-end in a
way that is similar to and will be simple to port over to a web-app type deployment with flask.
